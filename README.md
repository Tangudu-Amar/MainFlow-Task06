# Advanced Data Analytics Techniques
## Overview
This repository contains the work for Task 6 of my internship, focusing on advanced data analytics techniques. The objective is to apply sophisticated statistical and analytical methods to solve complex problems, with specific attention to time series analysis, sentiment analysis, text mining, and clustering or classification techniques.

## Project Description
### 1. Time Series Analysis for Forecasting
Objective: To forecast trends and analyze seasonality in time-dependent data.
Techniques Used: ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Seasonal Decomposition, and other time series models.
Tools: Python (pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib, etc.)
### 2. Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining
Objective: To extract meaningful insights from unstructured text data.
Techniques Used: Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis using lexicon-based and machine learning approaches.
Tools: Python (NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn, etc.)
### 3. Clustering and Classification Techniques
Objective: To explore segmentation and pattern recognition in data.
Techniques Used: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
